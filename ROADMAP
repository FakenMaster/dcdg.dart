# DCDG Roadmap

A list of non-trivial projects I'd like to accomplish here.

Refactor tests to rely less on (slow) functional tests and more on unit tests.
Basically, get back into alignment with the test pyramid.

Replace numerous options with a simple query language. For example, instead of
having to pass an `--is-a` option in order to filter down to subclasses of a
particular class, pass a simple query that can encapsulate this idea along with
other dimensions like class name, fields, etc.
