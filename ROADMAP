# DCDG Roadmap

A list of non-trivial projects I'd like to accomplish here.

Refactor tests to rely less on (slow) functional tests and more on unit tests.
Basically, get back into alignment with the test pyramid.

Abstract inclusion / exclusion into some kind of unified middleware pattern.
Right now some things are included / excluded when the source is traversed,
other things aren't enforced until the builder gets hold of the elements. This
will probably require a light abstraction over the top of the element structure
itself so that we can, for example, remove private fields before we hit the
builder.

Replace numerous options with a simple query language. For example, instead of
having to pass an `--is-a` option in order to filter down to subclasses of a
particular class, pass a simple query that can encapsulate this idea along with
other dimensions like class name, fields, etc.
